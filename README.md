🫁 Pneumonia Detection Using CNN

This project builds a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify chest X-ray images as NORMAL or PNEUMONIA. The model is trained on preprocessed X-ray images and aims to assist in quick, automated medical screening.

🚀 Key Features

CNN-based binary image classification

Data preprocessing: resizing, normalization, and augmentation

Clear model architecture with Conv2D, MaxPooling, and Dense layers

Training, validation, and testing pipeline

Streamlit interface for real-time image prediction

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python

TensorFlow / Keras

NumPy, OpenCV

Streamlit

📦 How It Works

Input X-ray image

Image is resized to 150×150 and normalized

CNN model predicts the class

Output: NORMAL or PNEUMONIA

▶️ Streamlit App

The project includes a simple UI where users can upload an X-ray image and instantly get a prediction.
